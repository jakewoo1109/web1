<p>We set-up our user-friendly website with rich information, including details, sample computation, photos and videos (for some) in order for the prospect buyers to have full information before site tripping and/or reservation. We intended this so that each buyer will purchase the correct properties.
We will not charge any amount to the buyers. What price in the developer office is the same as what we posted in our website. Buyers need to pay only to the developer office with our presence. We can assist the buyer in the processing of their document whether is it paid in cash, Pag-IBIG HDMF, bank financing, in-house financing and lease to own properties.
Our company is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as affiliated with 168 Land Realty Development Corporation. For over the years CEBU Real Estate Shop received multiple awards with real estate agents and broker registered with the Professional Regulation Commission (PRC).
